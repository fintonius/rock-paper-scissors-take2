# rock-paper-scissors-take2

Second iteration of making rock paper scissors as 
part of redoing the Odin Project. Have completed
this project before but I still want to do it again
as I have gotten very rusty in the intervening year.

Be interested to see what the differences between this
version and my first one will be!
