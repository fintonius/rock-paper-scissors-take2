# rock-paper-scissors-take2

Second iteration of making rock paper scissors as 
part of redoing the Odin Project. Have completed
this project before but I still want to do it again
as I have gotten very rusty in the intervening year.

Be interested to see what the differences between this
version and my first one will be!

ADDING UI TO GAME.

Project complete!
	That was quicker than expected. I definitely found this
	an easier task to complete than I remember the first attempt.
	It feels more to do with having a much better understanding 
	of how and why aspects of Javascript work rather than simply
	knowing the correct code to write.

	I don't remember how I completed the first version so it doesn't feel
	like I just repeated it here. Will need to take a look at 
	the earlier code to see how different it is.
